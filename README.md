Consistency
===========

A single command that gives you context-aware access to all your document styles and lets you create new styles without touching the inspector panel. When creating new shared styles, Consistency will also apply the style to all similar layers.

* Select any layer or group and press `⌘` + `ctrl` + `⌥` + `M`
* You can then select from existing styles or enter a name for a new style that will be applied.

Works with Layer Styles, Text Styles and Symbols.
